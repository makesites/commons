# Commons

A collection of common web assets based on the open standards set by the W3C, browser vendors and device manufacturers. 

The one rule for anything to be included in the commons is that it should be _development stack neutral_, meaning that it should apply rules independent of specific technologies the application may be using. 

An outline of each of the main repos follows: 

## Css

## Js

## Grid

## Webapp
